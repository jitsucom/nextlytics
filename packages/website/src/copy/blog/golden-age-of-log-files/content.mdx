# The Golden Age of Log Files

In the early days of the web, analytics was simple. Every time someone visited your page, your web
server wrote a line to `access.log`. That was it. No JavaScript. No third-party services. Just a
text file on your server.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, tools like [AWStats](https://awstats.sourceforge.io/), were the standard.
They parsed your Apache or Nginx logs and generated static HTML reports.

```
192.168.1.1 - - [29/Jan/2025:10:15:23 +0000] "GET /products HTTP/1.1" 200 4523
192.168.1.2 - - [29/Jan/2025:10:15:24 +0000] "GET /about HTTP/1.1" 200 2341
```

These tools gave you everything you needed: page views, unique visitors, referrers, and user agents.
All computed from data you already had.

Then things got complicated.

# The Curse of Pixels

As websites grew to multiple servers and CDNs, centralized logging became harder. The solution?
JavaScript tracking pixels.

It started innocently with a 1x1 transparent GIF. The browser requested this tiny image from an
analytics server, passing page information as URL parameters. Hence the name "pixel."

But pixels quickly evolved into complex JavaScript. Today, Google Analytics' `gtag.js` weighs around
**75 KB** — and it downloads another script adding **~100 KB** more. That's 175 KB just to count
page views.

And Google Analytics is rarely alone.

## The Script Parade

Major news sites load dozens of tracking scripts. Testing on media websites shows on a single article page. Each tracker:

- Adds network requests
- Blocks rendering
- Competes for CPU
- Can load even more scripts

## The Cookie Banner Curse

Then came GDPR in 2018 and CCPA in 2020.

These regulations require informed consent before setting tracking cookies. The result? Cookie
banners everywhere.

Now visitors face a wall of legal text before seeing your content. They click through (or bounce)
just to dismiss the modal. The user experience degrades further.

And what do these banners protect against? The very tracking pixels we added in the first place.

We created a problem, then created another problem to "solve" it.

## This is Madness

Here's what tracking and ads look like on major news websites:

By download size, most sites look reasonable. Content dominates. But look at the network requests:

<TrackingComparison metric="requests" />

NY Post makes **42% of its requests** just for tracking. Nearly half the network activity exists to
watch you read the news.

Let's summarize what modern analytics requires:

1. **Multiple JavaScript files** (100+ KB compressed)
2. **Dozens of network requests** to third-party domains
3. **Cookie consent mechanisms** with legal complexity
4. **Blocked by ad blockers** — losing 20-40% of data
5. **Slower page loads** affecting Core Web Vitals
6. **Privacy concerns** for your users

All to count page views. Something a 30-year-old Perl script did from a log file.

## Back to the Server

With modern full-stack frameworks like Next.js, every page request already hits your server. The
middleware runs. You have the request data. Why send it to JavaScript?

This is the idea behind Nextlytics.

**Everything happens server-side:**

- Page views recorded in middleware
- No client JavaScript for basic tracking
- No cookies needed for anonymous analytics
- No GDPR banners required
- No ad blocker interference
- Zero impact on page load

Your server already knows who visited what page. Nextlytics captures that and sends it to your
analytics backend — PostHog, Segment, your own database, whatever you prefer.

## What About Client-Side Events?

Some analytics genuinely require JavaScript. Google Ads conversion tracking. Facebook Pixel. These
need to run in the browser for attribution.

Nextlytics handles this too. Configure which backends need client-side code, and only those scripts
get loaded. Not a pile of trackers — just what you actually need.

## The Way Forward

Web analytics went from simple to absurdly complex. Thirty years of accumulated hacks and
workarounds.

With server-side frameworks now standard, we can return to the basics. Your server knows when users
visit pages. Let it do the tracking.

No pixels. No banners. Just accurate data.
